/// 
/// # Notes and Warnings
/// While it is easy to create a blinking LED with the delay() function and many
/// sketches use short delays for such tasks as switch debouncing, the use of
/// delay() in a sketch has significant drawbacks. No other reading of sensors,
/// mathematical calculations, or pin manipulation can go on during the delay function,
/// so in effect, it brings most other activity to a halt. For alternative approaches
/// to controlling timing see the Blink Without Delay sketch, which loops, polling the
/// millis() function until enough time has elapsed. More knowledgeable programmers usually
/// avoid the use of delay() for timing of events longer than 10â€™s of milliseconds unless
/// the Arduino sketch is very simple.
/// 
/// Certain things do go on while the delay() function is controlling the Atmega chip,
/// however, because the delay function does not disable interrupts. Serial communication
/// that appears at the RX pin is recorded, PWM (analogWrite) values and pin states are
/// maintained, and interrupts will work as they should.
///
