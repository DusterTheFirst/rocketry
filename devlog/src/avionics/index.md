# Avionics

The avionics are an important part of the rocket's stability and
success. Of course, the actual physical construction of the rocket
is a very important undertaking, but in order for that rocket to
maneuver itself autonomously, the rocket relies on the sensor data
input to the avionics as well as relying heavily on the output of
the avionics systems to keep it upright and stable.

The avionics cannot stand alone, they must be accompanied by a [rocket]
in order to actually be useful. Although most avionics are purpose built
for a specific rocket, they are not limited to a 1:1 pairing to a rocket.
The avionics are versatile and can be used and reused across many different
rockets. Each avionics version will have their own section with greater details
on the specifics of the system.

The avionics' source can be found on GitHub under the [`avionics/`] subdirectory
