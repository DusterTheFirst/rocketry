Viper, much like Slider has a lot of rough edges. I, being a software
developer at heart love code that works well and looks good, so I
eventually end up spending way too much time going into detail and
trying to make it perfect while neglecting the hardware. This can be
seen in the [first entry into the devlog][1].

The avionics will control a rocket using TVC given inputs from an IMU.
It will estimate the position of the rocket relative to its position on
the launchpad, attempting to stay pointing towards the sky.
