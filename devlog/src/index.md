# Introduction
This book is a log of the development of this project. I strive, to the best of my abilities,
to update the documentation with new findings and information on all tests conducted.
Using the power of git, the book with also link to the exact versions of 3d models/
firmware used during each test for closer inspection by the reader. This is meant to serve
as an archive of all information and development of the project

The book is divided into sections based on the nature of the item being developed.
Below is a summary of the sections:
- [Rockets] are the physical material projectiles that will take flight
- [Avionics] are the flight softwares onboard the rockets that are used for stabilization
