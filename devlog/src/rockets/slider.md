Slider is the first rocket to be made, It is very rough around the edges
but that is expected for a first. The rocket uses TVC based stabilization
during powered flight. The TVC gimbal uses 2 servos to provide around 5
degrees of movement in both directions. The gimbal is able to house any
18mm motor (generally an Estes A-C model rocket motor). The rocket is
only designed for powered flight, it relies on a parachute (or 2) to
slow its decent back to the ground. This parachute system is designed
to use no black powder and to be as reusable and safe as possible.
From testing, [it seems to be very finicky][chute-test] and needs more development
before a good solution is found.

All custom made parts for the rocket are 3d printed out of PLA plastic.
The plastic has been tested and [seems to be able to handle the stress
and heat from the rocket motor][tvc-test].
