# Rockets

Here is the home for all things rocket. These rockets however cannot
stand on their own, they are accompanied by some flight software which
in this documentation lives under the [Avionics] section. Each rocket
has its own section where it can hold all of the tests and development
associated with it as well as a landing page with more information on
each specific rocket.

The rocket's source can be found on GitHub under the [`rockets/`] subdirectory
