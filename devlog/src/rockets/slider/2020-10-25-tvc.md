# TVC Static Fire I
<sup>October 25, 2020</sup>

## Purpose
This test is designed to test the static force capabilities of the 2 axis TVC gimbal.
Although simple, this test aims to demonstrate that the TVC mount can hold its own under
load as well as maintain its strength under the high temperatures that the motor produces.

## Method
The TVC mount is clamped down to a stand, with the exhaust of the motor facing upwards with
no obstructions directly below or above to allow the exhaust and ejection charge to vent
safely. To protect the grass from the ejection charge, the exhaust guard from a launch pad
is placed below the mount.

The TVC mount is then filled with a rocket motor tube and a rocket motor with some tape around
the outside in order to increase the friction and ensure the motor does not leave the motor tube.
The motor should be setup with a starter and plug and inserted into the TVC mount's tube.

Once the motor is inserted into the mount, the starter's wires should be attached and area should be cleared.
After the area is prepared and safe, the motor should be fired.

After the motor has finished firing and the ejection charge has been vented, the motor should be removed from
the stand and the TVC mount should be thoroughly inspected for any problems before repeating the process with
another motor.

The process is repeated with both a B4 and C6 estes black powder motor

### 3d Models Used
- [Center Gimbal](https://github.com/DusterTheFirst/rocketry/blob/b0cf1f1de8338ad24c0d549cec9aca23268d9cd0/rockets/slider/renders/Center%20Gimbal.stl)
- [Middle Gimbal](https://github.com/DusterTheFirst/rocketry/blob/b0cf1f1de8338ad24c0d549cec9aca23268d9cd0/rockets/slider/renders/Middle%20Gimbal.stl)
- [Outer Gimbal](https://github.com/DusterTheFirst/rocketry/blob/b0cf1f1de8338ad24c0d549cec9aca23268d9cd0/rockets/slider/renders/Outer%20Gimbal.stl)

The three above models come together to form the TVC gimbal with them nested in descending order,
with the `Center Gimbal` being the inner most layer.

## Findings
The PLA plastic was unaffected by the heat of the motor, most probably due to the short amount of time the heat
was applied to the mount and the Kraft Paper motor tube acting as insulation.

The TVC mount held up to the forces of both motors very well, most probably due to the joints being made of
metal screws and metal inserts. There is not data however on how the servos will be able to handle pivoting the
mount under load.

The exhaust from the motor did not affect the bottom (when the rocket is facing upright) of the motor mount however,
the dirty ejection charge left the top of the motor mount covered in soot, but does not seem to have melted any plastic
or caused any deformation to the plastic construction.

## Changes To Implement
None
